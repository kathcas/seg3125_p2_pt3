            <p>NARRATOR:
(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
According to all known laws
of aviation,</p>
            <p>there is no way a bee
            should be able to fly.</p>
            <p>Its wings are too small to get
            its fat little body off the ground.</p>
            <p>The bee, of course, flies anyway</p>
            <p>because bees don't care
            what humans think is impossible.</p>
            <p>BARRY BENSON:
(Barry is picking out a shirt)
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</p>
            <p>Ooh, black and yellow!
            Let's shake it up a little.</p>
        </div>
